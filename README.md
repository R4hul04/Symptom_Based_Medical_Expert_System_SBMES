# Symptom_Based_Medical_Expert_System_SBMES

The project we worked on, the Symptom-Based Medical Expert System (SBMES), aimed to develop an intelligent system that could assist in diagnosing medical conditions based on symptoms provided by the user. 
The project involved the implementation of supervised machine learning algorithms, analysis of outcomes, and visualization of disease attributes. 
The overall objective of the Symptom-Based Medical Expert System project was to create an intelligent system that could assist in diagnosing medical conditions based on user-provided symptoms. 
By implementing supervised machine learning algorithms, analyzing their outcomes, and visualizing disease attributes, the SBMES aimed to provide accurate and efficient medical condition predictions. 
This system could potentially be used as a valuable tool for medical professionals or individuals seeking preliminary assessments of their health conditions based on symptoms.
